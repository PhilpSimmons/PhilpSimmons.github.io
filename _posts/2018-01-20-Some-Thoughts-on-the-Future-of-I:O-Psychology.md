The progression of modern society is both amazing and anxiety inducing. Seriously, the last two decades have produced the most profound changes to the human experience in history. We also happened to open ["Pandora’s Box" of manipulation.][link3] I often wonder how an unregulated technology industry may affect [humans][link4] and [society-at-large][link12] but these topics are better suited for a different blog post. What is indisputable, however, is that the advent of the internet, its use as a data collection instrument, and recent advances in statistical modeling has changed everything. [Medical diagnosis][link8], [stock market trading][link7], [music][link5], [shopping for bombs][link10], [findings jobs][link11], [driving][link6], [interacting with your family and friends][link9]…nearly everything we do in life is being quantified, analyzed, and used in ways we may or may not like with varying performance.

This advancement is particularly important for I/O Psychologists. Never has our field been better equipped to research and solve problems for organizations. The timing isn’t bad either, organizations are increasingly interested in understanding and optimizing the workplace. However, I wonder if our field, being small and not technologically savvy, will be there to answer the call. Are we just slow to embrace this opportunity or do we just not see it? My experience as a practitioner has opened my eyes to a few of issues: 

- First, **most I/O Psychologist have no formal training in enterprise systems, querying languages, and other basic skills required for data oriented work.** I anticipate that many practitioners will disagree that these are required skills for an I/O psychologist but hear me out. The lack of unique identifiers and basic "connectedness" between HR data sources is incredibly frustrating, getting raw data from vendors can be like pulling teeth and often isn't successful, and let’s face it - the products out there leave much to be desired. Many are designed for managers, not psychologists, yet we use them anyway despite questionable and unverifiable psychometric validity (sorry to those who work for product vendors). Homegrown data systems that give the researcher full control and capture the entire employee lifecycle from application to the exit interview is not only the holy grail of I/O but can significantly reduce bottom line expenses over time. To make these systems a reality, practitioners need some basic understanding of databases and programming to direct their development.

>"We allow our clients to drive our adoption of new technologies, only giving in when the ROI becomes irresistible. We begrudgingly adopt new software only when it becomes obvious we cannot do without it. Technology happens to us, and it’s time for that to change. We need to become our own agents of technological change. We need to understand technology well enough to help shape it for our purposes, whether this is to improve our own productivity or to provide our clients with the best services we can."

- Second, **as a field we are slow to adopt and teach new ways to conduct our work.** 
It feels as though we are approach a point where we must adapt to changes in technology or be left behind. Nearly every company I have worked for and interviewed with over the past few years have looked for candidates with knowledge of either R or Python. The exodus from SAS and SPSS does feel real, yet few of my colleagues care to invest the time to learn more sophisticated statistical programming. This is problematic because computer science programs around the country are churning out "machine learning" graduates who have the technical skills to do exactly what organizations want but lack the social science domain knowledge that allow for approaches based on theory and prevent unethical decisions. I plan to post R related content on this blog but until then [check out this post for Richard's Crash Course on R.][link1]

- Third, **our field struggles to approach and explain our work as a holistic product or system** that allows for organizational understanding and development via experimental research. There are so many moving parts in HR systems, each typically having an independent team and set of tools, that it often feels disjointed and chaotic. This complexity makes research difficult and hard to explain to outsiders looking in. I believe we can improve on the piecemeal status quo by attending to the two issues described above. Simplifying systems, setting rigorous psychometric standards, understanding databases and programing languages, and emphasizing experimental research may spark innovation that will help organizations much more than simple report and PowerPoint.

I find myself compelled to write about these issues because there is plenty of competition out there. [Y Combinator][link13], a successful startup incubator, has helped to fund over 1,400 companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit, Zenefits, and Gusto. Given their track record of funding successful companies, new startups entering this incubator may provide some indication of the direction of the Valley's disruptive force. Last year, in a [blog post][link2] by Y Combinator Partner, Jared Friedman, data suggested that companies are beginning to shy away from advertising as a primary revenue stream, likely because the [Google/Facebook Duopoly][link14] dominate much of the market. Instead companies are focusing more on software-as-a-service products - products that are purchased by consumers and do not rely on advertisements.

 Many of these applicants are, as Friedman put it <q>interest in applying AI to everything</q>. What caught my eye this year was the number of applicants funded by Y Combinator who are providing ML and AI based services that may directly impact the role of an I/O Psychologist (about 12% of the 82 companies total). Tech companies see the demand to solve business issues and have the talent to develop better HR data systems but will the I/O community be pleased with their approach in solving workplace issues?
