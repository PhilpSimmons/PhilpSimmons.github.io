The progression of modern society is both amazing and anxiety inducing. Seriously, the last two decades have produced the most profound changes to the human experience in history. We also happened to open a [Pandora’s box of manipulation.][link3] I often wonder how an unregulated technology industry may affect [humans and society-at-large][link4] but these topics are better suited for a different blog post. What is indisputable, however, is that the advent of the internet, its use as a data collection instrument, and recent advances in statistical modeling has changed everything. Medical diagnosis, stock market trading, music, shopping, eating out, findings jobs, dating, driving, interacting with your family…nearly everything we do in life is being quantified, analyzed, and used in ways we may or may not like.

This advancement is particularly important for I/O Psychologists. Never has our field been better equipped to research and solve problems for organizations. The timing isn’t bad either, organizations are increasingly interested in understanding and optimizing the workplace. However, I wonder if our field, being small and not technologically savvy, will be there to answer the call. Are we just slow to embrace this opportunity or do we just not see it? My experience as a practitioner has opened my eyes to a couple of issues: 

- First, **most I/O Psychologist have no formal training in enterprise systems, querying languages, and other basic skills required for data oriented work.** I anticipate that many practitioners will disagree that these are required skills for am I/O psychologist but hear me out. The lack of unique identifiers and basic "connectedness" between HR Systems is incredibly frustrating, getting raw data from vendors can be like pulling teeth and often isn't successful, and let’s face it - some products just suck and are designed for managers, not psychologists, yet we use them anyway (sorry to those who work for product vendors). Homegrown data systems that give full control to the researcher and capture the entire employee lifecycle from the initial application to the exit interview is not only the I/O holy grail but can significantly reduce costs long term. For this to be possible practitioners need some basic understanding of databases and programming to direct the development of these systems.

>"We allow our clients to drive our adoption of new technologies, only giving in when the ROI becomes irresistible. We begrudgingly adopt new software only when it becomes obvious we cannot do without it. Technology happens to us, and it’s time for that to change. We need to become our own agents of technological change. We need to understand technology well enough to help shape it for our purposes, whether this is to improve our own productivity or to provide our clients with the best services we can."

- Second, **as a field we are slow to adopt and teach new ways to conduct our work.** 
It feels as though we are approach a point where we must adapt to changes in technology or be left behind. Nearly every company I have worked for and interviewed over the past few years have looked for candidates with knowledge of either R or Python. The exodus from SAS and SPSS does feel real, yet few of my colleagues care to invest the time to learning statistical programming. I plan to post R related content on this blog but until then [check out this post for Richard's Crash Course on R.][link1]


- Third, **our field struggles to explain and approach our work as a holistic product or system** in which experiments are conducted. There are so many moving parts in HR systems, each typically having its own independent team and measurement tools, that it often feels disjointed and chaotic. This complexity makes research difficult to conduct and hard to explain to outsiders looking in. I believe the piecemeal status quo can be improved by attending to the two issues described above. Simplifying systems, having rigorous measurement standards, and understanding programing languages may help spark innovation that will help our clients more than a report or PowerPoint. 

I find myself compelled to write about these issues because there is plenty of competition out there. Y Combinator, a successful startup incubator, has helped to fund over 1,400 companies including Airbnb, Dropbox, Reddit, Zenefits, and Gusto. Given their track record of funding successful companies, new startups entering this incubator may provide some indication of the direction of Silicon Valley at large. Last year, in a [blog post][link2] by Y Combinator Partner, Jared Friedman, data suggested that companies are beginning to shy away from advertising as a primary revenue stream, likely because Google and Facebook alone dominate much of the market share. Instead companies are focusing more on software-as-a-service products - products that are purchased by consumers and do not rely on advertisements. Many of these applicants are, as Friedman put it "interest in applying AI to everything". What is interesting is the number of applicants funded by Y Combinator who are providing ML and AI based services that may directly impact the role of an I/O Psychologist (about 12% of the 82 companies total). Tech companies see the demand to solve business issues and have the talent to develop better HR data systems but will the I/O community be pleased with their approach in solving workplace issues?
